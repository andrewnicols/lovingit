Some useful git scripts to make easier some daily operations.

Note that they are dependent of:

- The naming schema used for moodle branches (MOODLE_XX_STABLE)
- My naming schema used for feature branches (_21, _22...)

But surely they can be easily hacked to suit your needs.

To install them:

- clone/download the repository.
- add it to your $PATH.
- create git aliases for them if you're really lazy or
  you aren't using autocompletion.

Then you'll be able to run:

- git currentbranch (cb): returns the current branch.
- git oldest-ancestor (oa): returns the oldest common ancestor
      (branch point) of two given branches.
- git pullall (pa): pulls all the upstream branches.
- git mrproper (mp): detects all the feature branches already
      merged/picked upstream, suggesting the git command
      to execute in order to get rid of them.

And that's all. Enjoy them!
